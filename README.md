# mosrin trajectory

I created this smooth trajectory generation library using numerical modelling for engineering and science work. In science and engineering smooth trajectory is essential for all kind of objects which are in motion, from rockets to bicycles, eagles to airplanes all need smooth trajectory to remain in control of their motion.
